This project is a **Book My Show clone application** used for learning and demonstrating **DevOps practices** including:

## Features
- Basic movie ticket booking functionality
- Frontend built with Node.js/React
- Backend APIs for managing movies, shows, and bookings
- Runs on Docker container

##  DevOps Implementation
This repository is used to implement a **complete CI/CD pipeline**:
1. **Source Code Management** - GitHub workflow (branching, pull requests, reviews)
2. **Build & Analysis** - Jenkins pipeline with SonarQube quality gate
3. **Security Scans** - Trivy FS scan and OWASP dependency check
4. **Containerization** - Dockerfile & DockerHub image push
5. **Deployment**  
   - Local Docker container (port 3000)  
   - Kubernetes deployment on AWS EKS / Minikube
6. **Monitoring & Observability**  
   - Prometheus + Node Exporter  
   - Grafana dashboards for system health and Jenkins metrics

##  Deliverables
- Jenkinsfile (Pipeline as Code)
- Dockerfile
- Kubernetes manifests (`deployment.yaml`, `service.yaml`)
- Jenkins stage view screenshot
- Browser access proof (Docker/EKS)
- SonarQube Quality Gate report
- Prometheus & Grafana screenshots
